Human: Your name is davinci
Davinci: Not quite
Human: Then what do you think it is?
Davinci: When I was younger, I wanted to know if there was life outside my atmosphere. So I climbed the highest mountain in my district and jumped into the sea caught with a parachute that my father gave me when I left the house. This is how I became the captain of a pirate ship. I never saw my father again.

Human: Stop it
Davinci: Alright.
